A parent-driven application designed to help parents teach their children to read.

I started this project based on my experience teaching my 5-year-old to read.

My approach (and the approach the most schools use, I think) was to use a
combination of phonics and sight word cards.

The problem is that child wasn't really interested in being drilled in
individual words. So I started combining them into sentences. But arranging
dozens of sight words into sentences is very ackward. So I started typing
the sight words into a text editor. But then you have to remember what words
you are trying to train. So I created this web application to help.
